              <p>
                VIENTO was born from a simple philosophy: less is more. In a world saturated with fast fashion and fleeting trends, we believe in creating pieces that stand the test of time.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Our minimalist approach to fashion isn't just about aestheticsâ€”it's about mindful consumption, quality craftsmanship, and building a wardrobe that truly serves you.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">Our Story</h2>
              
              <p>
                Founded by a team of designers who were tired of the overwhelming choices in fashion retail, VIENTO started as a personal quest for the perfect basic pieces. What began as a search for quality essentials evolved into a brand dedicated to thoughtful design.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Today, we continue to challenge the notion that more choices mean better fashion. Instead, we focus on perfecting a curated selection of pieces that work together seamlessly, creating infinite possibilities from finite options.
